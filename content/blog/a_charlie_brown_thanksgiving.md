The other night I got to watch *A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving* with my friends and I want to give you my thoughts:

This show is a classic and always a must watch for every thanksgiving. The story goes is that Charlie Brown is supposed to go to his grandma's for Thanksgiving. This was the plan until Peppermint Patty called and invited herself, Marci and Franklin over to Chucks house. So what happens next? Linus, Snoopy and Woodstock all get Thanksgiving dinner ready. (I should note that Thanksgiving in Charlie Brown terms is Toast, Popcorn, Pretzels and Jelly Beans. Quite honestly it would be a simple and good idea, my family has been known to throw traditions out the window and enjoy something that we would like and not the traditional meal for Christmas, or Easter) 

Snoopy helps a lot by setting up the table, playing Ping Pong (it is very improtant to make sure that the table is good to go by playing Ping Pong)
