This is going to be a small review for two games that I have been playing a lot lately, Stardew Valley and Bloond TD 6 (a future post). I am not a big gamer, I have never had the equipment to play these games before plus I have never been into FPS games. Minecraft is more my style. The most I'd had was a Windows XP (really good OS btw) that was able to play the Sims but I fell out of it as I grew up. Now that I have a computer of my own (A HP Z8 G4 running Windows 11, that was rescued from a company that was moving) I can now play and do what I want with it. I can now play these games but I can't get to crazy with rendering as the GPU is a Nvidia Quadro P2200 that is built for CAD and not gaming but it can get the job done. 

Onto Stardew Valley itself... The game is developed by Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone. It is a 2016 indie game where you inhert a farm from your grandfather. The game is self pased, you can play with friends or play on your own. I have been playing single player and have been enjoying it very much. It does take place in modern day where there are computers, TV so you are not to far off from the modern world. Speaking of which there is a company called JojaMart and it is evil. They say that everyone there is happy but by the look on this workers face that is not the case.
