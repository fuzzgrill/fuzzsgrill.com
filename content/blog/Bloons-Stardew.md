This is going to be a small review for a game that I have been playing a lot lately, Stardew Valley. I am not a big gamer, I have never had the equipment to play these games before plus I have never been into FPS games. Minecraft is more my style. The most I'd had was a Windows XP (really good OS btw) that was able to play the Sims but I fell out of it as I grew up. Now that I have a computer of my own (A HP Z8 G4 running Windows 11, that was rescued from a company that was moving) I can now play and do what I want with it. I can now play these games but I can't get to crazy with rendering as the GPU is a Nvidia Quadro P2200 that is built for CAD and not gaming but it can get the job done. 

Onto Stardew Valley itself... The game is developed by Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone. It is a 2016 indie game where you inhert a farm from your grandfather. The game is self pased, you can play with friends or play on your own. I have been playing single player and have been enjoying it very much. It does take place in modern day where there are computers, TV so you are not to far off from the modern world. Speaking of which there is a company called JojaMart and it is evil it wants to destroy the world that is known in the game. They say that everyone there is happy but by the look on this workers face that is not the case.

You can defeat JojaMart by rebuilding the community center, and this is the route that I prefer as it takes down a corp that has no buisness being in the valley. 
I was talking to a friend one day and I said
>they remind me of the simple quiet folk that love to do nothing (I would love that life)

It is very much true and I would love that life. You spend your days living in the peace and quiet and not surrounded by the chaos in the city. 
I enjoy playing the game it brings a sense of calm to me after a long and crazy day at work or a crazy day in general. I love comeing home and signing into the game and just playing. There are moments that I have to look at the wiki becuase I don't know where someone or something is. It is nice that there is an entire community behind the game that has played the entire thing and can be there to help you if you get stuck. 

I have found myself loging on at 11pm and playing until 1am becuase it is so easy to get lost into the game (and yet my steam states that I have 3hrs on record, but I think there is something wrong with it, as it says I last played on Jan 2 but I played it eailer this week) I highly reccommend this game and to think it is worth the 14.99. I got it on the Steam winter sale for a bit cheaper. I do not regret getting the game at all, it is avaible on all major platforms (sorry NES players, but it's not avaible to you). 

Multiplayer is avaible and allows up to 8 players, and I have heard it is a lot of fun. I am apart of a server that plays Stardew most weeks and it is fun to sit there and listen to them chat away about the game, they started playing before I got the game but I am happy to have a game that we all share in common aside from Minecraft. 

I asked a very close friend for her thoughts on the game so far and she said: 
>I find the game to be quite charming. It's whimsical nature appeals to me a great deal. The mechanics are wonderfully crafted, and I find myself fully absorbed for hours whenever I play. The reason for this is that the game speaks to one of our deepest callings as human beings: to cultivate and have dominion over the earth. Before the fall of man and sin ever entered the world, God called hard work good. Hard work and building beautiful things has always been a part of creation. Genesis 2:15 says, "The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it." Farming, gardening, taking care of nature, and improving the lives of those around you are distinctly biblical calls, which is why so many humans are naturally drawn to doing those things. We were created to do them, and this game provides a simulation for us to fulfill those desires artificially, which is why many people find it so addicting. (This is partly the reason I limit myself to one session a week, or I will get sucked into the artificial world and forget that God's commands apply to the real world). 
The deep backstory and path of every character is very well-designed, with redemptive and satisfying storylines. The Junimos and the chickens particularly appeal to me and I find their character sprites quite endearing. I love how extensive the exploration is and the difficulty level seems to scale quite well. Overall, it's been a great experience and I would reccomend it to anyone.

If you are looking for a game that is very fun to play and relaxing this is the game to play.
