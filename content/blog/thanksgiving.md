Last weeks post is a bit late, sorry about that. Saturday was a bit crazy plus Hugo was not playing nice... ok lets move off that

With Thanksgiving around the corner I want to share some of my thoughts about it along with Fall. 
I love fall, the coolness of the weather (if you live in an area that experieces fall), the rain, and the confusing weather changes. As the leaves change color it can be pretty and super nice as they crunch. I will admit that I get dissapointed when the leaves don't go crunch. 

So what does Fall mean to mean?
It means that it is time to go to school and enjoy the chaos that comes with it. It means sitting around the fire and playing on the Nintendo Switch. I love to sit back and play games on the switch. Sitting there while I am throwing around Cappy in *Super Mario Odyssey* or smaking Darth Vader with a Baguette (which is a light saber that is skinned the famous french bread) in *Lego Starwars the Skywalker Saga* a classic game that reflects on the games that I grew up with. It brings me back to the days of sitting with my brother playing these games. 

There is one downside that I am not of is the cold, but I guess you need to have the cold for some reason, I am sure that there is a good reason but I don't like the cold. When you need to go to the freezer in the garage and the concrete is cold you should hope that everything that you need is easy to find, however there is always something nice about making some hot food. OR grabbing some hot coco as you walking though downtown, on your way to your car.
