There is a word that I have been putting in my posts for a while, I am going to let you find it... Need an idea? Look at the text below...

>. They are zippy, can be good in the snow and ice (like the Chevy Bolt, does well in the snow) and simply a lot of fun. They don’t require a lot of maintenance either. They don’t need oil changes, filter changes or any of the `traditional` repairs that a gas car needs. 
(evs)

>(I should note that Thanksgiving in Charlie Brown terms is Toast, Popcorn, Pretzels, and Jellybeans. Quite honestly it is a simple and clever idea, my family has been known to throw `traditions` out the window and enjoy something that we would like and not the `traditional` meal for Christmas, or Easter) 
(A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving)

>One of my favorite traditions that comes with Thanksgiving is all the food that can be made. I am not sure why, but it is rare for us to make Green Bean Casserole though out the year. I know its `tradition` and it should be reserved for Thanksgiving and Christmas but there have been times where it would be nice to have it and maybe a turkey sandwich with it. I know I know; I just described a stripped-down Thanksgiving dinner, but think about it, is there a reason why we can’t have some of the Thanksgiving foods at any point in the year? I don’t see why not (again `tradition`, but it is `tradition` to change those `traditions`). 
(Thanksgiving there are so many in here I am not going to list all)

Tradition that is the word that I have been putting in the past three posts (from "EVs", "A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving" and "Thanksgiving"). With that word being thrown around a lot I want to sit and tell what it means to me, what what it might to you. 

Tradition is stated as something that is not supposed to change and there is no reason for it to do so. *Fiddler on the Roof* is all about Tradition and the opening number is called "Tradition" where the cast tells the audience what each roles of the family do. The papas are there the master of the house, and read the holy book. The mommas are there to make sure that the house runs nice and smooth. The sons are there to learn how to work and the daughters are there to lean how to mend, tend and fix, preparing for married life. This was created in the time when matchmakers were around and sons and daughers did not know who they are to be married to, and (I am going to assume that) this was also when it was expected to have several children as soon as possible. 

To me tradition can either be something that is worth it or not. Growing up we followed the tradition of making things as we go, be kind to those around you and to give love rather hate. Some of those things are still there, my brother and I would always be nice and help anyone along the way. We also followed the tradition of being at church at 9:00 am every Sunday and be apart of service even not knowing what is going on at all. Sometimes you would be at one church and another time you would be at the other chruch. 
There is another tradition that I am a fan of and it's us breaking the traditions that we have created in the first place. We have started to do things that we have never done before, we are making burgers and hotdogs for Easter dinner (when it is only the four of us) last Christmas we decided to go with Tritip steaks that were in the freezer (we have a connection with a company that supplies meats at a reduced price, a lot better quality too). We love to make or break the ideas of something that we are supposed to, I love to break traditions and start new ones. 

One thing that I want to ask you is how do you celebrate tradition? Do you play it by the book and keep things the same though out the entire time that it happens? or do you not have a tradition and that is the tradidtion? 

One thing that I feel that we should be getting used to is breaking the tradiions that we have today. There is no rule in place that states that we have to keep things the same
